    "**Anomaly detection**\n",
    "    \n",

    "**Density estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is the task of estimating the probability density function (PDF) of the random process that generated the dataset. Density estimation is commonly used for anomaly detection: instances located in very low-density regions are likely to be anomalies. It is also useful for data analysis and visualization."

    "#### Clustering is used in a wide variety of applications, including these:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For customer segmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can cluster your customers based on their purchases and their activity on your website. This is useful to understand who your customers are and what they need, so you can adapt your products and marketing campaigns to each segment. For example, customer segmentation can be useful in recommender systems to suggest content that other users in the same cluster enjoyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For data analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you analyze a new dataset, it can be helpful to run a clustering algorithm, and then analyze each cluster separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a dimensionality reduction technique**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once a dataset has been clustered, it is usually possible to measure each instance’s affinity with each cluster (affinity is any measure of how well an instance fits into a cluster). Each instance’s feature vector x can then be replaced with the vector of its cluster affinities. If there are k clusters, then this vector is k-dimensional. This vector is typically much lower-dimensional than the original feature vector, but it can preserve enough information for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For anomaly detection (also called outlier detection)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Any instance that has a low affinity to all the clusters is likely to be an anomaly. For example, if you have clustered the users of your website based on their behavior, you can detect users with unusual behavior, such as an unusual number of requests per second. Anomaly detection is particularly useful in detecting defects in manufacturing, or for fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For semi-supervised learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you only have a few labels, you could perform clustering and propagate the labels to all the instances in the same cluster. This technique can greatly increase the number of labels available for a subsequent supervised learning algorithm, and thus improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For search engines**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some search engines let you search for images that are similar to a reference image. To build such a system, you would first apply a clustering algorithm to all the images in your database; similar images would end up in the same cluster. Then when a user provides a reference image, all you need to do is use the trained clustering model to find this image’s cluster, and you can then simply return all the images from this cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To segment an image**\n",
    "\n",
    "    By clustering pixels according to their color, then replacing each pixel’s color with the mean color of its cluster, it is possible to considerably reduce the number of different colors in the image. Image segmentation is used in many object detection and tracking systems, as it makes it easier to detect the contour of each object."
